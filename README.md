# SnakeGame
 
### A Console Snake Game written in C++ using Object Oriented Programming Concepts (OOP)

## Game Rules:
* The Greedy Snake wants to collect as much dollars as he can
* The Greedy Snake keeps moving forward without stoping, but he trusts you to give him a good direction using your WASD-keyboard-keys
* As Legends Say, the more dollars you collect the taller your tail will be (as a Greedy Snake I mean üòÅ)  
The Greedy Snake's tail grows with every collected dollar
* If the Greedy Snake hits a wall, he dies and unfortunately loses all the collected money
* If the Greedy Snake eats his tail instead of a dollar, he dies and unfortunately loses all the collected money
* Help the Greedy Snake to collect as many dollar as you can !

## Program Details:
* The Game is designed and made Flexible and Maintainble, so it's easy to maintain and update it later
* Every part of the program is maintainble no fixed values, we can change (Board size - Snake's drawing - Type of the collected coin .. etc) 
* The Game isn't meant to have a great Graphical User Interface (GUI), but the point is making the game with a correct, efficient ans elegant Algorithm.. then the GUI can be added later
